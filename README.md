#Duck Sightings
This work was my first touch to React, Node and Less. It uses webpack to run on.
It's the interface to access an API server about duck sightings, and the
pre-assignment for Vincit's search of summer interns.

You can get the API-server needed from [here](https://github.com/Vincit/summer-2018/).

##Information

I've included a compiled version in the build-folder, which doesn't require any server to run other than the API-server the data is fetched from.

To run a dev-server, run
```
npm run start
```

To only compile, run
```
npm run build
```
The compiler will output into the 'build'-folder.
